### List some popular uses for pfSense.
- Some popular uses for pfSense are VPN routers, transparent squid proxy servers, DNS blacklist, Internet cafes, etc. 

### What are the hardware requirements for setting up a pfSense router?
- After looking at the pfSense direct website some of the hardware requirements are a modern multi-core processor and a 64-bit processor is required for new versions. You have to have at minimumn 2GB of RAM but for better performance you should have 4 GB or more. You have to have one  or more compatible network interface cards, 8 GB or larger disk drive like an SSD or HDD. and a Bootable USB drive or high capacity optical drive for initial installation.

### Reflect on the importance of cultural awareness in the field of network security and administration. How might cultural differences influence decision-making and problem-solving when dealing with virtual routers and firewalls, like pfSense, in a global context.
- Decision making can be influenced by cultural differences where for example the military would have more of a hierarchical decision making process where somewhere like a startup company would have more of a consesnsus type decision making skills. Cultures could also have an influence on problem-solving strategies where some cultures might be more focused on risk avoidance where as in a culture like in a learning environment it might be more risk-tolerant and that can affect how security issues are handled.

- ## Things I want to know more about.
- - I'm interested now in getting an old computer to experiment and mess around with pfSense especially to use it as a VPN router, so I would like to do more research into that.
