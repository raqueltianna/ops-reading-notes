# Ops Readings

## Reading 2 
1. Which is better in a CPU, more cores or higher speed? Under which circumstances is that true? How many CPU cores does a computer need?
    Higher speed is better if you need to process data faster but more cores can improve performance. Only time that you need to more than 6 cores if you are building a high performance gaming PC.
2. What details are you looking for when finding a motherboard which fits your processor?
    You want to check the socket type on both the motherboard and the processor. The CPU socket must match the motherboard's socket for them to be compatible.
3. What are the tradeoffs you’d evaluate while selecting a storage device?
    You would decide if you must choose a hard drive disk or a solid state drive. SSDs are faster and smaller with no moving parts and they are more expensive than an HDD. Most users use a SSD as their boot drive and a HHD for their files. 
4. Think about others with a background similar to yours. How would you explain to them the key parts of a computer, in a way they’d best connect with?
     Having a strict medical background I would tell others that the CPU is kind of like the medical director. The hospital can not run without them because they decide on how the hospital is ran and create all the protocols that the doctors, nurses, etc go by. I would describe the motherboard as the doctors or providers. The motherboard is the backbone that ties all of the parts together and I feel (more specifically in the section that I work in) is that the doctors do the same. They deal with the higher ups and then dissiminate that information to the nurses and other workers. The doctors also help the nurses interact with the patients and without the doctors we wouldn't be able to do certain task like administering medications or certain treatments. I would say RAM are like traveling nurses because they are not full time staff so they have to quickly learn the way certain hospitals or clinics work for a short time and then they move on and learn the way other hospitals work so they are constantly gaining and then losing information to gain information from another source. The storage devices would be the full time nurses that know the way the hospital they are at work and they become full of knowledge and processes of the hospital.

   ## Things I want to know more about

   - In the wiki article it says "purchase a graphics card if necessary." The only real knowledge I have on computers come from gaming PC's so I never really thought about other PC's not having a graphics card. It says that it's not a major issure for a computer you plan on using for daily task. I'm curious as to why that is because I would think that each computer would need one.
