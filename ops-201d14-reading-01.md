### What is the purpose of the Windows System Restore tool?
  - It allows you to revert to a previous restore point like prvious software or driver configuration. It is a great too to troubleshoot especially after updating operating systems.
### How long does it usually take to use the System Restore tool in Windows?
  - In most cases it takes around 10 to 30 minutes to utilize the System Restore tool. On the website "softwaretestinghelp.com" they said that if the system restore is taking longer than 45 minutes it more likely that the software is likely stuck and it may freeze. 
### How do you start a System Restore from the command prompt?
  - In the command prompt you would type **rstrui.exe** and then press enter and then the System Restore will automatically open.
### What options are available if System Restore did not fix the problem?
  -You can repeat the System restore again an choose an older restore point then the one you used earlier. The second option in the article was that you could "continue troubleshooting the problem." I was curious as to what some other options could be besides just trying to run it again so I asked chatgpt. Some of the options chatgpt listed were check for malware, check for disk errors, run windows update, and about nine other options. 

## Things I want to know more about
- I am curious on let's say you had Windows 10 on your computer and then you updated to Windows 11. If you did a system restore would it revert your computer back to Windows 10?
