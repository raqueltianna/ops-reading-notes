### What is the Windows Registry, and what does it store?
- It is a collection of several databases. There are settings to make the registry either apply to all user or be user-specific. It stores configuration setting and information about the system, hardware, etc. 

### What are the two types of registry settings stored for each Windows user account?
- HKEY_CURRENT_USER (HKCU), which contains user-specific settings and HKEY_USERS(HKU), which contains all users. 

### What are “registry hacks” and why might someone want to use them?
- Registry Hacks are changes made to the Windows Registry to change specific settings in the OS. Someone might want to use this for customization purposes or for security purpose. An example of how it could be used for security is by changing setting to block access to certain features or websites.
  
### What are some common tasks you can perform by editing the Windows Registry?
- You could block user accounts from running specific Apps, add an application to your desktop's context menu, and stop other user accounts from sutting down your pc. 

### Imagine you’re explaining the concept of the Windows Registry to someone who has never used a computer before. How would you make this explanation culturally relevant and relatable to their life experiences or background?
- The way I would describe this to somebody who has never used it but has been a medical assistant, I would describe the WIndows Registry as a patient's medical chart. Every patient has their own chart specific to them with essential information about them. The chart helps the doctors who in this case is the computer, make decision on the plan of care. So the Registry helps the Computer make decisions on how to run. Just like with a medical chart you have to be careful on how you make changes with the Registry.  

## Things I want to know more about

- I think I would like to learn mroe about how I can use the registry to make changes on how my PC runs and behaves.
