## Windows Command Line Tool


### How can you list the files in the current directory using the command prompt?
- If you are in the command prompt you can type "dir" command and you can move between directories using the "cd" command.

### How might the “sfc” command and the “gpupdate” command help in troubleshooting on Windows?
- The "sfc" command checks and repairs corrupted or missing files this could help with blue screen errors or apps crashing because of the corrupted files. The "gpupdate" command forcese a refresh of the Group Policy settings on a Windows system which could help if you had changed to the group policy settings. 

### What advantages does the “robocopy” command offer over the “xcopy” command, and why is it useful for file transfers in certain situations?
- Robocopy is a more in-depth version over xcopy which is more simple tool. Robocopy has greater control and reliability and is more useful for large file transfers, network interruptions, etc. It can also resume file transfers that were interrupted. You can also do multithreaded copying which allows for improved copy performance and dealing with numerous small files, along with many other functions.   

### Think about any real-life scenarios from your cultural context where the use of command line tools could be beneficial. Describe one such scenario and explain how a specific command line tool would help address the situation.
- During the pandemic in 2020 when we were seeing at least 100 people a day due to covid I think the command prompt "awk" would have been very helpful. We could have all the patient files in a dataset and then use awk to write a script to filter the data. For example since we were tracking the what cities these patients lived in, ages, etc., we can use awk fto filter through that to help with epidemiology greatly. 

## Things I want to know more about
- I think the main thing that I want to know more about in rergards to this article is mostly learning more commands and their function.
