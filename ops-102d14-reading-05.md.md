# Ops Reading

## Reading 5

1. Explain the terms “shell”, “terminal”, “cli”, and “command prompt”. Why are these still used today, when we have graphical interfaces?
     - Shell: A program that allows the user to access the operating system's service. It reads the user's commands and translates that t othe operating system.
     - Terminal: This is where the commands are put into to communicate with the shell. It inputs the commands to the shell.
     - CLI: Stands for command line interface. It is an interface that lets the user interact by typing text commands into the terminal. We type this after the command prompt. 
     - Command Prompt: It is text or a symbol (in our Ubuntu it is represented with a "$") that let's us know that it is ready to accept commands. Our name and current directory is also in the command prompt. 
2. What are the commands to change directories, list the file’s contents and rename/move files?
     The command to change directories is "cd". The command to list the file's contents is "ls". The command to rename or move files is "mv". To rename the file you would type "mv (the old file name) (the new file name)". To move it to another directory you would put "mv (the file) path/to/destination/"
3. What are relative and absolute paths? What is special about starting with a ~ (tilde) or a ‘/’ character in the path?
      A relative path shows the location of a file/directory in relation to the directory that we are currently working on or using, while absolute path specifies the full path from the rool to the file/ directory. The Tilde (~) help to quickly acess the home directory without needing to type out the full path directory, and the forward slash is used as a separator for directories. 
4. Explain what Linux is, using anything except English.
     Linux je besplatan i otvoren operativni sistem koji se koristi na računarima i drugim uređajima. On je baziran na Unix operativnom sistemu. Linuxa pristup otvorenim izvorima, što znači da svako može pregledati, menjati i deliti kod operativnog sistema. Ovo ga čini veoma prilagodljivim i omogućava korisnicima da ga prilagode svojim potrebama. Osim toga, Linux se često koristi za serverske sisteme, veb hosting i razvoj softvera, ali se takođe može koristiti i za svakodnevno korišćenje na ličnim računarima. (My best friend has been teaching me Serbian for the past year and he helped me describe Linux in Serbian). 


## Things I want to Learn More About
- https://www.linuxfoundation.org/blog/blog/classic-sysadmin-how-to-move-files-using-linux-commands-or-file-managers I used this link because I was curious to get a little bit more in depth about the specific commands to move files and rename files.
- I would like to continue to learn more about different command prompts that can be used for different tasks.
