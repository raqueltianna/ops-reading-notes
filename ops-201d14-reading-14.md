# Reading: Malware Remediation Tools and Techniques 

### What are the main differences between anti-virus and anti-malware software?
- The main differences between anti-virus and anti-malware Antivirus focuses on things like viruses and trojans while anti-malware is more broad and includes things like adware and ransomware. 

### What are some signs or symptoms that may indicate a malware infection on your PC?
- Some signs that your PC is plagued is slower than usual performance, spate of pop-ups, and other issues.

### Explain the difference between a full system scan and a quick scan when using antimalware software.
- A full system scan is a more thorough search through your entire system while as a quick scan targets specific areas for more common threats. 

### What should you do if your computer is infected with ransomware?
- Use should use antivirus or antimalware to scan and remove the ransomware. You should also restore your computer from a restore point from before the ransomware was placed onto your computer. The best step to mitigate ransomware is early on prevention.

### Compare and contrast malware removal techniques in Windows PCs with those in other operating systems like macOS or Linux. How might these different approaches reflect the cultural values and priorities of the technology users?
- Linux deals with malware by package managers and having limited privileges. I think this reflects Linux priorities of open source and community development. Mac uses software like Gatekeeper that restricts downloads to the app store or known developers. Which I think shows how Mac tends to be in my words "self-sufficient" and to keep everything internal. Windows uses antivirus software and built in tools like Windows Defender which I think shows their priority of users really having a choice in how they use and manage their own Windows. 

## Things I want to know more about 
- I've never reeally looked into malware infections and I only have really noticed that it was thing if there were visual indicators like pop-up ads. So I would like to know more about the more silent malwares and what to look out for. I would also like to know that besides getting a pop up or blocker when downloading possibly infected files, how can you make sure that there is no type of malware on a download?
