# Reading: Cloud Virtualization with AWS 

### How has virtualization evolved beyond desktops and servers?
- Virtulization evolved beyond desktops and servers by now also covering the network, storage, data, device, and applications. 

### In the context of the Amazon IaaS Cloud Service Model, what does EC2 stand for?
- EC2 stands for Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud. It is essentially an IaaS service that provides virtual servers based on the Xen hypervisor.
  
### What types of storage does EC2 use, and how is EC2 web traffic managed?
- EC2 use storage through either Ephemeral (temporary) or Elastic Block storage snapshots. EC2 web traffic is managed through load balancing to distribute incoming traffic.

### What are the benefits of service-oriented architecture for customers of EC2 virtualized services?
- According to the AWS website some benefits of SOA are faster time to market, efficient maintenance, and greater adaptability.
  
### Analyze how cloud virtualization can promote equitable access to technology resources across diverse populations. How can this technology bridge cultural gaps and empower underserved communities?
- Cloud virtualization can promote equitable access to resources through things like having data centers world wide allowing a more global out reach. There are also ways for things like labs and trainings through remote learning allowing learning through geographical barriers. There is also personalized learning making it more adaptive to certain people. I think overall this can help cultural gaps and undeserved communities by overall allowing accessibility, because it allows people with limited money to still utilize cloud resources.
