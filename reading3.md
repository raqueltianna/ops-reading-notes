1. What is the BIOS?
   The BIOS is the utility program which loads the operating system when the computer is turned on.
2. Use analogies from your previous background to explain what happens during the booting process?
     For my flight medicine job we have something called pre-flight, where before we take off we go through every single piece of equipment we have to make sure they are all working the way they are suppose to be which I would say is similarly to the Power-on self-test. The boot device selection is similar to us trying to decide based off of what patients we are going to have we decide on where we are going to place our equipment and the specific order that we are going to bring equipment onto the aircraft.
     The Hardware Configuartion is similair to our "function checks." It is similar to the pre-flight but our function checks are done on aircraft power instead of regular power. It is almost like a double check for all of our equipment. The CMOS setup utility is similiar to us setting certain parameters on each of our equipment for certain patients. For example an infusion pump (what you give IV's through) we would put the date, the time, how long the infusion needs to be running for, the patient's weight, etc on it.
     The low-level system control is us landing and handing over a patients to the receiving MTF. When all of our processes and level of care is complete after landing we hand them over to the ERPS who takes control of the patients and takes over their care.
3. What is the “Power On Self Test”?
   The POST is a process during the booting process that checks the hardware necessary to run the OS and apps. 
4. What is the CMOS?
    The Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor is the memory on the motherboard that stores the BIOS settings.
8. What is the CMOS battery?
     The CMOS batter powers the BIOS in your PC. 

## Things I want to know more about
    I wouldn't say there is anything that I really would like to know more about regarding the BIOS and CMOS. I think reading this article and the other resources, plus our instructor explaining and going through the processes made a lot of sense to me.
