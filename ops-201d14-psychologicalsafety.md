# Reading: Psychological Safety

### What are three key factors that contribute to psychologically safe teams?
- Three key factors that contribute to psychologically safe teams in my opinion are trust, being able to openly commuicate, and feeling supported by your team and leadership.

### Evaluate, with details, a previous professional setting (or team) you were in with regards to psychological safety.
- I think a good situation in regards to psychological safety is when I was in basic training. Being in an unknown enviornment, away from the people you know and love, and thrown into a dorm with 30 other females that you do not know it could for sure get very hectic an tense. I feel after the first few days when the your out of the sneaker week, things start to get tense. You start to kind of get annoyed of seeing each other, hearing each other breath, and even more annoyed with the people who snore super loud and make it hard to even sleep. There was a lot of bickering even over the littlest things people were even arguing over what showerheads people get to use. I remember that the third or fourth week that we were in basic training, we were told that the world had pretty much broke out into a pandemic and that our families wouldn't be able to come and watch us graduate. It was a low blow to us knowing that we were going to have to go straight to tech school and not even get to see our families inbetween so that of course caused the tension to rise even more. On Sunday the only day we had somewaht of personal time we decided to all talk to each other. We talked about our families, things we liked to do outside of basic training, shared pictures of our pets, and just overall got to know each other. I think that was the moment where we realized that we are all people going through the same thing at the moment and we were all kind of feeling the same. After that my flight ended up with flight excellency for our high pt scores, dorm cleaninless, our marching, and our overall dress and appearance. I think us setting around and really getting to know each other besides the tense moments allowed us to really connect and become a team.

### What impact do teams that operate with a high degree of psychological safety have on their company and the team members?
- I think one impact that a team that operates with a high degree of psychological safety is job satisfaction and retainability. I think having good psychological safety could make employees feel valued and heard making them enjoy their job more and stay with a company. I think it could also lead to higher productivity. Me personally I work hard at everything that I do but I feel I would put even better work out for a team that I felt important and valued in my role. It could also impact collaboration and overall improve teamwork.

## Things I want to know more about
- I think the main thing I want to know about this topic is how you can implement psychological safety even if you are not technically in a position of leadership within the group.
