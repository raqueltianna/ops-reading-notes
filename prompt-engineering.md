  - The prompt that I typed in was "Explain to me what an Aerospace Medical Evacuation Technican is in regards to the Airforce."
  - The response was:
        An Aerospace Medical Evacuation Technician in the United States Air Force (USAF) is a highly trained healthcare professional responsible for providing medical care to patients during the transportation of injured or critically ill individuals on military aircraft. These technicians play a crucial role in the Aeromedical Evacuation (AE) system, which is a specialized aspect of military medicine that involves the evacuation of military personnel, dependents, and other eligible beneficiaries who require medical attention.
        Here are the key responsibilities and duties of an Aerospace Medical Evacuation Technician:
              Patient Care: Aerospace Medical Evacuation Technicians are trained to provide advanced medical care to patients during transport. They assess and stabilize patients, administer medications, monitor vital signs, and address any medical emergencies that may arise in-flight.
              Safety and Comfort: Ensuring the safety and comfort of patients during transport is a primary concern. Technicians secure patients and their medical equipment properly to prevent injury during takeoff, landing, and turbulence.
              Medical Equipment Management: They are responsible for maintaining and operating specialized medical equipment on board the aircraft, such as ventilators, cardiac monitors, and other life-support devices.
              Coordination: Aerospace Medical Evacuation Technicians work closely with the flight crew and medical personnel to coordinate patient transfers, in-flight medical care, and the efficient use of available resources.
              Documentation: Accurate record-keeping is essential to track the patient's condition, the care provided, and any changes that occur during the evacuation process. This documentation is crucial for continuity of care at the receiving medical facility.
              Training: These technicians receive extensive training in aeromedical evacuation procedures, emergency medical care, and aviation safety. They must stay current with evolving medical techniques and equipment.
              Patient Advocacy: Advocating for the well-being and medical needs of the patients is a key responsibility. They ensure that patients receive appropriate care and attention throughout the journey.
              Security and Safety: Aerospace Medical Evacuation Technicians may be involved in loading and unloading patients onto and from aircraft, and they are responsible for ensuring the safety and security of patients during these operations.
       Aerospace Medical Evacuation Technicians are typically assigned to Aeromedical Evacuation Squadrons or Units within the Air Force. They are often involved in a variety of missions, including the evacuation of wounded service members from combat zones, the transfer of military personnel and their families between bases, and responding to humanitarian and disaster relief operations.
       These professionals play a crucial role in the overall medical readiness and capabilities of the United States Air Force, ensuring that injured or ill individuals receive the necessary medical care during air transportation, ultimately contributing to their recovery and well-being.
  - I was actually surprised by how in depth this went. I feel that if you search up an Aerospace Medical Evacuation Technician on just on Google without a cac card, it doesn't go in to depth with the response, I feel that it is somewhat vague. Of course it didn't go into depth about our operations and other classified information but I still thought it was pretty fascinating that you could just type that in.

  - The prompt that I typed in was "Tell me about an Air Force C-130."
  - The response was:
        The Lockheed C-130 Hercules is a four-engine turboprop military transport aircraft designed and built by Lockheed (now Lockheed Martin). Capable of using unprepared runways for takeoffs and landings, the C-130 was originally designed as a troop, medevac, and cargo transport aircraft. The versatile airframe has found uses in other roles, including as a gunship (AC-130), for airborne assault, search and rescue, scientific research support, weather reconnaissance, aerial refueling, maritime patrol, and aerial firefighting. It is now the main tactical airlifter for many military forces worldwide.
        The C-130 entered service with the U.S. in 1956, followed by Australia and many other nations. During its years of service, the Hercules has participated in numerous military, civilian and humanitarian aid operations. In 2007, the transport became the fifth aircraft to mark 50 years of continuous service with its original primary customer, which for the C-130 is the United States Air Force (USAF). The C-130 is the longest continuously produced military aircraft at more than 60 years, with the updated Lockheed Martin C-130J Super Hercules being produced as of 2023.
        The C-130 is a highly versatile aircraft that can be used for a wide variety of missions. Some of its most common missions include:
            - Troop and cargo transport
            - Airborne assault
            - Search and rescue
            - Medical evacuation
            - Aerial refueling
            - Maritime patrol
            - Weather reconnaissance
            - Aerial firefighting
            - Special Operations
        The C-130 is a rugged and reliable aircraft that can operate in a variety of conditions. It is capable of using short, unpaved runways, and can fly in both hot and cold climates. The C-130 is also a relatively fuel-efficient aircraft, making it a cost-effective choice for many missions.
        The C-130 is a vital part of the airlift fleets of many militaries around the world. It is a versatile and capable aircraft that can be used for a wide variety of missions. The C-130 is likely to continue to be in service for many years to come.
  - I feel that this is the normal information that I expected if I did a random google search about a C-130. I was curious as to what chatgpt would say about this exact same prompt and it went way more in depth, giving information like how many trops is could care and going more into depth about certain wars that they were utilized in. Chatgpt also went into depth about newer models of the aircraft. I think if I wanted a somewhat vague search, something to use to lead me in the right direction I would use Google Bard and if I wanted a more concrete option I would use chatgpt/ openai.
