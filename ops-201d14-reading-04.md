### What should you do if multiple issues are happening simultaneously during troubleshooting?
- If multiple issues are found, you need to be sure to have good documentation of all of the problems so you can get a better look at the total issue.

- Once you identify a solution you should implement the solution. You should also have multiple solution plans or a plan to revert back.

### What are the benefits of documenting the entire troubleshooting process in a knowledge base?

### Think about a technological device particularly popular in your culture or community. Imagine a scenario where issues arise: how would you apply CompTIA A+ troubleshooting methodology to help, while considering the end-userâ€™s cultural background?
- A piece of equipment that is used often in the medical field is a Propaq md which is an electronic vital monitor that also tracks heart rhythm and pace. The first step would be to identify the problem that the nurse or doctor is having whether that be the software, the accuracy, etc. Then based off of the information or the problems that they give I would come up with an idea of the probable cause. I would then make sure that it isn't a small issue causing the problem like a loose connection or no power. Then I would establish and implement an action plan. After resolution I would document the outcome and all the steps that I took. I would then explain to the nurse, small troubleshooting suggestions to help prevent issue in the future.
