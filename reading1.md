# Tianna's Ops Reading Notes 

## Ops Readings

### Reading  #1 

1. How is a hardware hack different than a software hack? 
    Hardware hacks are more devastating and long-term. Hardware hack creates trails of componets like shipping manifest and fatories.
2.  What are the two ways for spies to alter a computerâ€™s hardware?
     One way that spies alter equipment is by manipulating devices as they're in transit from manufacturer to customer. The other method is by making changes from the beginning while in factories which gives China a big advantage due to them being the biggest producer of devices suchs as phones and pcs. 
3.  Explain how the hack worked.
    The chips that the hackers had used had been inserted while in the factory. They made the chips inconspicous making them look like signal conditioning couplers, another common motherboard component making them not detectable. The chips manipulated the core operating instructions that tell the server what to do as data moves across a motherboard. The chip was placed in a way that allowed it to effectively edit this information que, injecting its own code or altering the order of the instructions. The chip allowed the attackers to alter how the device function. 
4. How were investigators able to trace the chips back to the source?
      To track the chips, investigators following the supply chain in reverse by sifting through communications, tracked key players through their phone and then eventually traced the chips to four subcontrtacted factories. 


## Things I want to know more about 
 - What is the difference between adding a file and a wiki on Github?
 -I read through and I think I have a good understanding of the ISC2 Ethics but I would like to know more about what is considered going against the ethics? I can see how if someone was accused of that how they could try and say that it is situational or that it is based off of interpretation so I would like to know what is the clear defining line when it comes to them.
