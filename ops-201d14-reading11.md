# Reading: Data Restoration, Startup Repair, and Secure Disposal

### What are some common indicators that an SSD may be failing? 
- Some common indicators that an SSD may be failing are if your computer crashes but runs "normally after several reboots. Another indicator is that your SSD will not operate except if you are doing read-only functions. Other indicators are things like frequent file corruption, bad sectors, and missing files or directories. 

### How do SSD failures differ from HDD failures in terms of detectability? 
- Some differences of detectability is that HDDs have audidble signs of failer like grinding noises while SSDS are silent. SSDs failures are also more predictable because they have more built-in warning when they are at the end of their lifespan. 

### What are bad blocks in an SSD, and how do they affect its performance?
- Bad blocks are sections of memory cells that are defective. They are unable to store data and cause data corruption or other issues. Bad blocks can affect performance by slowing down read operations, writing performance, reducing the life of the SSD, etc. 

### How can power cycling an SSD help resolve certain issues?
- Power cycling can help an SSD resolve certain issues by clearing temporary data and ressing restting the drive's internal state. It can help with some issues like if the SSD has an error you can use power cycling to clear error states.
  
### How might this topic be relevant in the aftermath of a natural disaster? Describe how individuals or communities can use these techniques to recover data and resume their normal activities.
- During natural disasters things like power surges and power loss happen which can cause data corruption on SSDs, which power cycling can help clear those temporary issues. Just like with natural disasters and SSDs its important to have recovery plans and back up strategies to help with restoring data and post distater recovery. 

## Things I want to know more about 
- The main thing I would like to know about that I have never really looked into before is the health of my SSD and what preventative measures I can take to ensure its longevity.
